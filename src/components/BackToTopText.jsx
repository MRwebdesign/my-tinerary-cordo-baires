      Why, those are the Grunka-Lunkas! They work here in the Slurm factory.
      WINDMILLS DO NOT WORK THAT WAY! GOOD NIGHT! Yeah, I do that with my
      stupidness. No! The kind with looting and maybe starting a few fires! Yes.
      You gave me a dollar and some candy. For one beautiful night I knew what
      it was like to be a grandmother. Subjugated, yet honored. Ah, the
      'Breakfast Club' soundtrack! I can't wait til I'm old enough to feel ways
      about stuff! And from now on you're all named Bender Jr. I guess if you
      want children beaten, you have to do it yourself. Why would I want to know
      that? Oh, I always feared he might run off like this. Why, why, why didn't
      I break his legs? You, minion. Lift my arm. AFTER HIM! I daresay that Fry
      has discovered the smelliest object in the known universe! Oh, I don't
      have time for this. I have to go and buy a single piece of fruit with a
      coupon and then return it, making people wait behind me while I complain.
      Hello Morbo, how's the family? Ah, yes! John Quincy Adding Machine. He
      struck a chord with the voters when he pledged not to go on a killing
      spree. Kids have names? Now, now. Perfectly symmetrical violence never
      solved anything. Please, Don-Bot… look into your hard drive, and open your
      mercy file! And I'm his friend Jesus. She also liked to shut up! But I
      know you in the future. I cleaned your poop. I don't 'need' to drink. I
      can quit anytime I want! It must be wonderful. Yeah, I do that with my
      stupidness. We can't compete with Mom! Her company is big and evil! Ours
      is small and neutral! Too much work. Let's burn it and say we dumped it in
      the sewer. I wish! It's a nickel. I was having the most wonderful dream.
      Except you were there, and you were there, and you were there! Anyone who
      laughs is a communist! Of all the friends I've had… you're the first. Now
      what? And when we woke up, we had these bodies. I don't want to be
      rescued. Also Zoidberg. You guys go on without me! I'm going to go… look
      for more stuff to steal! Bender, you risked your life to save me! THE BIG
      BRAIN AM WINNING AGAIN! I AM THE GREETEST! NOW I AM LEAVING EARTH, FOR NO
      RAISEN! In your time, yes, but nowadays shut up! Besides, these are adult
      stemcells, harvested from perfectly healthy adults whom I killed for their
      stemcells. I never loved you. A sexy mistake. Whoa a real live robot; or
      is that some kind of cheesy New Year's costume Why, those are the
